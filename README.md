# bmsdabakke
Encryption and decryption of a message!

This project is an application skeleton for a simple html web app using nodejs and mongo.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the bmsdabakke repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the bmsdabakke repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).


### Clone bmsdabakke

Clone the bmsdabakke repository using [git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/riderrocks/bmsdabakke.git
cd bmsdabakke
```

### Install Dependencies

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm]

```
npm install
```

Now you should find that you have a new folder 'node_modules' in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need

### Run the Application

I have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
